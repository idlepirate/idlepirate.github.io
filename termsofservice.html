<p><strong><b>User Content</b></strong></p>
<p>Any communications, comments, chats, sounds and images, and all the material, data, text, graphics, photographs and their selection and arrangement uploaded to the Services (“<strong><b>User Content</b></strong>”) are subject, whether in whole or in part, to unlimited commercial, worldwide, non-commercial and/or promotional use by XiaoLinfu.</p>
<p>You hereby grant XiaoLinfu and its affiliates a perpetual and irrevocable, worldwide, fully paid-up and royalty free, non-exclusive, unrestricted, unconditional, unlimited license, including the right to sublicense, transfer and assign to third parties, and right to copy, print, host, reproduce, fix, adapt, modify, improve, retitle, translate, reformat, archive, store, cache or otherwise exploit in any manner, create derivative works from, manufacture, introduce into circulation, commercialize, publish, distribute, disclose, sell, resell, license, sublicense, transfer, rent, lease, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, or provide access to electronically, broadcast, communicate to the public by telecommunication, display, perform, enter into computer memory, and use and practice, in any way now known or in the future discovered, in any media, at any time, your User Content as well as all modified and derivative works thereof in connection with our provision of the Service, including advertising, marketing and promotions thereof. No credit, approval or compensation is due to you for any such use or disclosure of the User Content you may submit.</p>
<p>Any text, graphics, and photographs and other User Content uploaded by you shall be your sole responsibility. Thus, users are solely responsible, and XiaoLinfu is not responsible, for any User Content users upload, post, share, or otherwise make available. XiaoLinfu may or may not regulate User Content and does not guarantee the accuracy, quality, or integrity of any User Content on any of the Services. By using the Services, you acknowledge and accept that you may be exposed to material you find offensive or objectionable. You agree that XiaoLinfu will not under any circumstances be liable for any User Content, including, but not limited to, errors in any User Content, or any loss or damage incurred by use of the User Content. XiaoLinfu reserves the right to remove and permanently delete any User Content from the Services with or without notice for any reason.</p>
<p>You agree that you are willingly publishing the User Content on the Services using technology and tools provided by XiaoLinfu. You understand and agree that you may not distribute, sell, transfer or license your User Content and/or application in any manner, in any country, or on any social network or other medium without the explicit written permission of XiaoLinfu. You grant XiaoLinfu the right to act as an agent for User Content on your behalf as operator of the Services.</p>
<p>By transmitting or submitting any User Content while using the Services, you affirm, represent and warrant that such transmission or submission is (a) accurate and not confidential or misleading; (b) not in violation of any laws, contractual restrictions or other third party rights, and that you have permission from any third party whose personal information or intellectual property is contained in the User Content; (c) free of viruses, adware, spyware, worms or other malicious code; and (d) you acknowledge and agree that any of your personal information within such content will at all times be processed by XiaoLinfu in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>XiaoLinfu reserves the right in its sole discretion to review, monitor, prohibit, edit, delete, disable access to or otherwise make unavailable any User Content (including without limitation your User Content) without notice for any reason or for no reason at any time. If at any time XiaoLinfu chooses, in its sole discretion, to monitor the Services, XiaoLinfu nonetheless assumes no responsibility for User Content and assumes no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate User Content. If XiaoLinfu, in its sole discretion and within its rights under this Agreement, selects User Content to edit or delete, XiaoLinfu nonetheless assumes no responsibility or obligation to remove or modify any other inappropriate User Content. XiaoLinfu has the right, but not the obligation, in our sole discretion to edit, refuse to post, or remove any User Content.</p>
<p><strong><b>User Interactions</b></strong></p>
<p>You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users of the Services and any other parties with whom you interact through the Service and/or XiaoLinfu’ games. XiaoLinfu reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between users. You will fully cooperate with XiaoLinfu to investigate any suspected unlawful, fraudulent or improper activity, including, without limitation, granting XiaoLinfu access to any password-protected portions of your Account.</p>
<p>If you have a dispute with one or more users, you release us (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.</p>
<p><strong><b>Virtual Currencies/Goods</b></strong></p>
<p>The Services may include an opportunity to earn and purchase virtual, in-game currency, including but not limited to virtual coins, points and credits (collectively, “<strong><b>Virtual Currency</b></strong>”) that may require you to pay a fee using lawful currency or “real money” to obtain the Virtual Currency. The Services may also include virtual, in-game digital items (collectively, “<strong><b>Virtual Goods</b></strong>”) that may be purchased from XiaoLinfu with “real money” or with Virtual Currency. Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods can never be redeemed for lawful currency, goods, or any other item of monetary value from XiaoLinfu or any other party. You acknowledge and agree that Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency are licensed to you for your use through the Services and are subject to applicable laws and rules, the Terms, and limitations and terms set out in each game.</p>
<p>Your purchase of Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods is final and is not refundable, exchangeable, or transferable. You may not purchase, sell, or exchange Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods outside of the Services. These transfers are strictly prohibited, and we shall not be liable for any claims or damages suffered by the users with respect to Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods purchased or obtained from any third party. Doing so is a violation of the Terms and may result in termination of your account with the Services and/or legal action taken against you.</p>
<p>XiaoLinfu retains the right to modify, manage, control and/or eliminate Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods at its sole discretion. Prices and availability of Virtual Goods and services are subject to change without notice.</p>
<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT XiaoLinfu IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, IN THE EVENT OF A REFUND AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT PROCESSOR WILL APPLY AND ANY RELATED FEES SHALL BE BORNE BY YOU; AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE LAWFUL CURRENCY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL CURRENCY AND VIRTUAL GOODS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.</p>
<p><strong><b>Updates to the Service</b></strong></p>
<p>You understand that each Service is an evolving one. XiaoLinfu may require that you accept updates to the Services and to XiaoLinfu’ games that you may have installed on your device or computer. You acknowledge and agree that XiaoLinfu may update the Services and XiaoLinfu’ games, with or without notifying you. You may need to update third party software from time to time in order to receive the Services and play XiaoLinfu’ games.</p>
<p><strong><b>Rules of Conduct/Usage</b></strong></p>
<p>The Services may provide communication channels such as forums, communities, or chat areas (“<strong><b>Communication Channels</b></strong>”) designed to enable you to communicate with other users of the Services. XiaoLinfu has no obligation to monitor these Communication Channels, but XiaoLinfu may do so and reserves the right to review materials posted to the Communication Channels and to remove any materials, at any time, with or without notice for any reason, at our sole discretion. XiaoLinfu may also terminate or suspend your access to any Communication Channels at any time, without notice, for any reason. You acknowledge that chats, postings, or materials posted by users on the Communication Channels are neither endorsed nor controlled by XiaoLinfu, and these communications shall not be considered reviewed or approved by XiaoLinfu. XiaoLinfu will not under any circumstance be liable for any activity within Communication Channels.</p>
<p>You agree that all your communications with the Communication Channels are public, and thus you have no expectation of privacy regarding your use of the Communication Channels. XiaoLinfu is not responsible for information that you choose to share on the Communication Channels, or for the actions of other users.</p>
<p>You agree that your use of the Services shall be lawful at all times and that you will fully comply with the usage rules in all respects. In furtherance of the foregoing, and for illustrative purposes only and not as a limitation, you agree not to use the Services in order to:</p>
